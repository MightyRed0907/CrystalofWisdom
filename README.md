Crystal of Wisdom(The Pharaoh's Challenge)

This is a hypercasual game related ancient Egypt.
I focused to make a simple, but original game containing Pharaoh, pyramid, sand, and the crystal.
The entire scenario of the game is as follows:
------------------------
The ancient Egyptians were masters of knowledge, their wisdom almost akin to magic. Legend has it that the great Pharaohs' pyramids hold secrets beyond our wildest imaginations, with crystals that contain all the knowledge they created while alive. These crystals remain hidden within the walls of the colossal pyramids and the sands of the desert, guarded by the mummies of the Pharaohs for eternity.

But the journey to uncover these secrets is not for the faint of heart. The labyrinthine pyramids are filled with traps and unknown creatures that lurk in the shadows, ready to pounce on unsuspecting adventurers. Yet, despite the dangers, our hero - you - are determined to find the crystals of knowledge hidden within the pyramid of Pharaoh Imhotep, one of the most brilliant minds of ancient Egypt.

As you venture deeper into the pyramid, the air grows thick with the scent of ancient magic, and the walls seem to pulse with a mysterious energy. You can feel the weight of history bearing down on you, but your determination never wavers.
There, you meet the great Pharaoh Imhotep, but he does not easily let you reach the crystal.
He makes the proposal of playing a game with his mummies, in which your life is betted.
To win the Pharaoh with knowledge, and to get the Crystal of Wisdom, you accepts the challenge of Pharaoh.
-----------------------------------------

So I made the game consist of four rounds, each of which allowed you to get one piece of crystal.

In the round, there are grids that you move one step at a time, and a mummy is trying to capture you.

You should find a route to reach the crystal, avoiding the mummy.

The mummy's intelligence power is limited, so he only relies on the sounds you make, but he can move twice as fast as you move once.

Both you and the mummy can't pass the walls, and the mummy's always trying to follow you straight, so if you use the walls well, you can trap them inside and make yourself free to reach the crystal.

As you pass every round, you will collect the pieces, and once all four pieces are gathered, you win the game.

Please be a wise guy and get wiser.
